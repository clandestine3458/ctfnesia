Description:
Yavan sent me these really large numbers... what can they mean? He sent me the cipher "c", the private key "d", and the public modulus "n". I also know he converted his message to a number with ascii. For example:

"nactf" --> \x6e61637466 --> 474080310374

Can you help me decrypt his cipher?
